# custom-tables-WordPress
This Code Will Create Custom Tables into WordPress Database with the name of '{prefix}_custom_cities' and '{prefix}_custom_streets'. And After that We send a call to the URL to get cities with all the streets names that exists in that city. And There is one more part to call the streets name when user select the city.This functionality is done by using wp ajax hook. We just simply need to add this code into functions.php and add .js code into js file of the active theme.
